### CNF definition

[Conjunctive normal form - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctive_normal_form) 

1. Remove bi-implicate
2. remove implicate
3. Doing the morgan
4. Doing distributive

## Explain

Step 1,2 and 3 will be handle by function

    Node *cnfFilter(bool isNegation = false);

This function will be overrided in each base class.
To protect memory on heep, cnfFilter will return new deep copied tree.

For the distribution, I have used function

    Node *cnfDistribution();

This function will be overrided in each base class.
This function used on the deep copy of origine tree (which is generated by `cnfFilter(..)`) to prevent `SIGSEGV` error.

Class will be execute above two function in it constructor and return `cnf` as a pointer.
